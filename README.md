# Docker-project
Multi-Tier Architecture-Docker Compose

In this project we will built a multi-tier architecture in docker.
In multi-tier architecture the software is engineered to have the processing, data management, and presentation functions physically and logically separated.
We will start and understand from the simple docker container run command to build the architecture by linking different docker containers and then we will move to the next part of managing that using docker compose.
