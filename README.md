# Docker-project
Multi-Tier Architecture-Docker Compose

In this project we will built a multi-tier architecture in docker.
In multi-tier architecture the software is engineered to have the processing, data management, and presentation functions physically and logically separated.
We will start and understand from the simple docker container run command to build the architecture by linking different docker containers and then we will move to the next part of managing infrastructure using docker compose.

# Things we will do
> Docker info: 
  We will know the basic knowledge of docker images, containers and commands to work with them.
  
> Creating Volume and Architecture:
  We will know about volume, environmental variable, linking containers, will manually create the infrastruture using docker run
  command and will understand every part of the command.
  
> Problems we face:
  We will see the problems when manually creating the infratructure and know about docker-compose to solve it.
  
> Project docker-compose:
  We will create a multi-tier architecture using docker-compose with detailed steps.
